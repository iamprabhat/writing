# I’m from Earth.
## Howdy<i>!</i>

I am <b>Prabhat Kumar</b> — <i>CEO, Founder & Data Scientist</i>, of [Sequømics](http://sequomics.com/) Corporation.

I'm not only scientist, mathematician, engineer, design thinker and core innovator; also administrator, environmentalist, humanitarian and social activist — working to bring innovations as well as possibilities into the human life.

I'm also very passionate about invention and innovation through Research and Discovery activity. I have involvement mainly in Algorithms, Data Science, Machine Learning, NLP, Predictive Analytics, Data Visualisation, Scientific Computing, as well as in Information & Technical Architecture, providing best software solutions through commitments.

I have dedicated my entire professional and personal orientation toward developing myself into not only being the best possible “scientist” I can be, but being one step ahead of the curve at all times.

It is my personal choice not to have any single goal or idol, because I believe that once you reach your goal and surpass it you will start to stagnate; instead I have a direction in which I am developing my talent hoping it — <i>will always bring unique and measurable results for the mankind.</i>

I'm utilising my full force of thought-provoking formidable mind with moral and ethical sense to answer — <i>"How specific questions must be analysed in terms of best possible solutions that brings upliftment of not merely in science and technology, but for the whole human civilisation?".</i>

Enjoy the mother — <b>Earth</b>,<br/><br/>Thanks.
